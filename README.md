# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bike-share data from Cyclistic, focusing on differences in bike usage between casual riders and annual members. The goal is to understand rider behavior in terms of ride duration, frequency, time of day, and station usage. Insights from this analysis can help optimize marketing strategies and operations for Cyclistic.

## Key Questions
- How do casual riders and annual members differ in ride duration and frequency?
- What are the most popular stations for each rider type?
- When do peak hours occur for each rider type?
- How can Cyclistic improve retention and conversion of casual riders?

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **R**: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Excel**: Initial data review and manipulation.
- **R Markdown**: Documentation and report generation with integrated visuals.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Importing and inspecting the raw bike-share data for Q1 2019 and Q1 2020.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning the data, adding key metrics (e.g., ride length, day of week), and combining datasets.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Summarizing and visualizing key trends in ride frequency, ride duration, and peak hours.
4. **Visualization**: Generating visualizations to compare ride patterns for casual and member riders.
5. **Reporting**: Documenting the findings using R Markdown and exporting relevant data for further analysis.

## Results and Insights
- Casual riders tend to ride longer and more frequently on weekends.
- Annual members use bikes during weekdays and for commuting purposes.
- Different peak usage times for casual and member riders suggest opportunities for targeted marketing and improved station management.

## Next Steps
- Further analysis could include the impact of weather or special events on rider behavior.
- Exploring additional data sources such as demographic or bike maintenance records could enhance the analysis.
